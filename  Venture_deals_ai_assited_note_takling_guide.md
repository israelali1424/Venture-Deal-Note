# üõ†Ô∏è Process and AI Tools Used to Create My _Venture Deals_ Notes

The notes for the book were created using the assistance of several AI tools.

## üß± Step 1: Prompt Design

The first step was using the **Prompt Professor GPT ChatGPT extension** to create a prompt that would generate the output I was looking for. It took several iterations, but the current version of the prompt I am using to create my notes is:

```markdown
### Instruction

You are an expert in venture capital and startup fundraising.

Your task is to summarize **Chapter X** of _Venture Deals_ by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson in a structured, educational format designed for readers who are new to venture capital.

### Question

What are the **main topics, key concepts, and terms** discussed in Chapter X of _Venture Deals_?

Please follow this structure:

1. **Organize the response by the chapter‚Äôs main sections or headings**  
   (e.g., ‚ÄúThe Venture Capitalist,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Angel Investor,‚Äù etc.)

2. For **each section**:

   - Provide a **clear section heading**.
   - Write a **concise but detailed summary** (4‚Äì6 sentences) explaining the purpose and main takeaways.
   - Use bullet points for subpoints where helpful.

3. When you mention any important **key term**, acronym, or VC-specific concept (like _drag-along rights_ or _vesting_):

   - **Bold** the term.
   - **Immediately follow it** with a **beginner-friendly explanation in parentheses**.  
     _Example: **Vesting** (a system where founders earn their shares over time, so they don‚Äôt leave with all their equity early)._

4. The tone should be:

   - Professional but accessible.
   - Friendly to beginners in startup finance.
   - Optimized for clarity, learning, and retention.

5. Use **Markdown formatting**:

   - `##` for main sections
   - `**bold**` for terms
   - `-` for bullet points
   - Avoid long paragraphs

6. At the end, provide a brief **1-paragraph recap** of what the chapter teaches and why it matters for startup founders.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Step 2: Review and Annotate

After the notes are created, I review them to ensure all core content from the chapter is included, and that all **key terms are defined**.

I will also add **extra notes** that I find helpful to enhance the clarity or usefulness of the content.

## üìê Step 3: Formatting for Markdown

The output from Notebook LLM is in Markdown but often comes in large blocks of text, which makes it harder to scan and read quickly.

To improve readability, I copy the text and paste it into ChatGPT with this prompt:

```
better format this text for markdown. Do not change the content of the note, only the format.
```

so the final output will be digestible

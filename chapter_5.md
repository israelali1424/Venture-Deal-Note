## Valuation and Price

This section explains how **valuation** (the value ascribed to a company by an investor) directly influences how much of a company is sold and the resulting **dilution** (reduction in percentage ownership of existing shareholders due to new share issuance). There are two key types:

- **Pre-money valuation**: The company's value _before_ the investment.
- **Post-money valuation**: The **pre-money valuation** plus the new investment amount.

A common trap for **entrepreneurs** (individuals who create new companies) is when a **VC** (Venture Capitalist) states a **valuation** without specifying if it's **pre-money** or **post-money**, often leading to a lower effective **pre-money valuation** than the entrepreneur expects. The **agreed-upon valuation** (the value of the company agreed upon by the investor and company) determines the **price per share** (the dollar amount assigned to purchase one share of stock).

## Employee Option Pool

The **employee option pool** (shares set aside by a company to provide stock options to employees) is a crucial part of the **valuation** negotiation, as it directly impacts founder **dilution**. **VCs** often insist that any increase to this pool occurs _before_ the financing, meaning existing shareholders bear the **dilution**.

- Typical early-stage **employee option pools** range from **10% to 20%** of the company on a **fully diluted basis** (meaning all rights to purchase equity are included in the valuation calculation).
- Entrepreneurs can negotiate the **pool size**, the **pre-money valuation**, or when the increase is factored in, effectively negotiating the price.

It’s essential to understand that **unissued options** (options that have been authorized but not yet granted to employees) are what **VCs** are primarily concerned with when discussing the **employee option pool**.

## Warrants

**Warrants** (a right to purchase shares of stock in a company) are a form of compensation that gives the holder the right to buy a company's stock at a predetermined price.

- Common in **bridge loans** (a short-term loan that bridges a company to its next major financing or event).
- Often paired with **convertible debt** (a loan that is intended to convert into equity at a later date).

In such scenarios, **warrants** effectively grant a **discount** on the future **equity** price for taking on early risk. While generally reasonable in **bridge rounds**, **entrepreneurs** should ensure they are structured fairly and avoid "double-dipping" (where an **investor** receives both a **discount** and **warrants**).

## How Valuation Is Determined

**Valuation** is not an exact science, but rather a guess influenced by various factors:

- **Competition with other funding sources**: More interest generally leads to higher valuations.
- **Experience of the entrepreneurs and leadership team**: Reduces perceived risk.
- **Size and trendiness of the market**: Larger or hotter markets often command higher valuations.
- **VC's natural entry point**: Typical investment stage and valuation preference.
- **Current economic climate**: Market conditions play a role.

**Entrepreneurs** are advised not to take **valuation** personally, as **VCs** are negotiating to their advantage. The best way to maximize price is to have multiple interested **VCs**.

## Liquidation Preference

**Liquidation preference** (a right given to a class of **preferred stock** allowing that stock to receive proceeds in a **liquidation event** in advance of other classes of stock) is a crucial **economic term** that dictates how proceeds are distributed during a **liquidation event**.

- **Preferred stockholders** get their investment back—sometimes a multiple—before **common stockholders** receive anything.
- Involves **participation**, which can be:

  - **Full participation**: No cap.
  - **Capped participation**: Participation up to a certain multiple.

An important related concept:

- **Liquidation preference overhang**: The amount that must be returned to investors before **common holders** receive anything.

For companies with multiple financing rounds, **liquidation preferences** can be:

- **Stacked**: Later series get preference first.
- **Pari passu**: All preferred series share _pro rata_.

---

## Pay-to-Play

**Pay-to-play** provisions require existing **preferred stockholders** to participate **pro rata** in future financing rounds. If they don’t:

- Their **preferred stock** may convert into **common stock**, losing special rights.

These provisions:

- Became common after the dot-com bubble.
- Are generally seen as **company-friendly**.
- Can be problematic for **angel investors** or **micro VCs** who don’t do follow-on investing.

## Vesting

**Vesting** is a system where founders and employees earn their **stock** or **stock options** over time.

- Standard schedule: **Four years with a one-year cliff**.
- If someone leaves early, **unvested stock** typically reverts to the company.
- This creates **reverse dilution** (remaining shareholders increase their effective ownership).

Acceleration types:

- **Single-trigger**: Vesting accelerates upon acquisition.
- **Double-trigger**: Accelerates upon acquisition _and_ termination without cause (more common in **VC-funded deals**).

Though initially contentious, **vesting** is widely accepted as a tool for alignment.

---

## Exercise Period

The **exercise period** is the window in which a **stock option** can be converted into shares by paying the **strike price**.

- Not typically found in **term sheets**, but closely related to **vesting**.
- Early **exercise** can provide **tax advantages** by converting **ordinary income** to **capital gains**.

Current employees often delay **exercise**, but those who do it early may benefit significantly.

## Antidilution

**Antidilution provisions** protect **investors** from **dilution** if the company raises money at a lower **valuation** in the future.

Main types:

- **Weighted average antidilution**: Adjusts price based on weighted average of old and new valuations.
- **Full ratchet antidilution**: Reprices earlier shares to match the lowest price in the new round (more aggressive).

**Antidilution carve-outs**: Exceptions where **antidilution** does not apply (e.g., employee stock grants or certain debt conversions).

Though complex, **antidilution** encourages companies to maintain or increase **valuation** in future rounds.

# üìò _Venture Deals_ ‚Äì Chapter 2 Summary

**"Preparing for Fundraising" by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson**

This chapter highlights the critical preparatory steps entrepreneurs must take before embarking on a fundraising journey to maximize their chances of success and minimize common pitfalls.

## üß≠ Preparing for Fundraising

The chapter begins by underscoring that **preparation** (_the act of getting ready for a venture capital financing_) is paramount for entrepreneurs seeking investment.

- Many significant issues can be preempted and avoided by being proactive and organized before engaging with potential investors.
- A key component of this preparation involves selecting and working closely with a competent legal advisor who understands venture deals.
- This proactive approach sets the stage for a smoother, more efficient fundraising process.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Choosing the Right Lawyer

Selecting the right legal counsel is a foundational step for any startup.

- An experienced lawyer acts as an **integral partner** (_a crucial collaborator who guides a company through its legal and corporate lifecycle_) from a company's inception through to an acquisition or IPO.
- Entrepreneurs should evaluate attorneys based on:

  - **Experience level** (_proven track record in representing startups_)
  - **Cost** (_balancing hourly rates with efficiency_)
  - **Communication style** (_ensuring comfort and clarity_)

- A knowledgeable startup attorney can:

  - Offer valuable insights
  - Help avoid common legal pitfalls
  - Connect founders with resources like investors and accelerators

## üïπÔ∏è Proactive vs. Reactive

To meet investor expectations and streamline the fundraising process, companies should take several **proactive** steps:

- **Corporate Structure**

  - Structure the company as a **C Corporation** (_a specific legal entity where the corporation is taxed separately from its owners_)
  - Register in **Delaware** (_a state favored for corporate incorporation due to its robust and predictable corporate law_)
  - Avoid pass-through tax entities like LLCs

- **State Qualification**

  - Ensure the company is **qualified to do business** (_registered as a foreign corporation_) in every state it operates

- **Data Site**

  - Establish a **data site** (_a secure digital repository, like Dropbox or Google Drive, for organizing company documents_)
  - Facilitates **due diligence** (_the investor's investigative process before investment_)

- **Capitalization Table**

  - Keep the **capitalization table (cap table)** (_a detailed spreadsheet outlining all company stock ownership, including common, preferred, options, and warrants_) accurate
  - Be well-versed in its contents for investor conversations

- **Document Review**

  - Review and ensure all organizational documents, financial records, and agreements are properly executed
  - Address any issues proactively before fundraising

## üß† Intellectual Property

**Intellectual property (IP)** (_creations of the mind, such as patents, copyrights for code, trademarks for brands, and trade secrets_) is often a company's most valuable asset.

Entrepreneurs must:

- **Document Chain of Title**

  - Demonstrate a clear, documented chain of **title for all its intellectual property** (_legal proof of ownership_)

- **Confidentiality and Assignment Agreements**

  - Ensure every founder, employee, and service provider signs **confidentiality and IP assignment provisions** (_agreements transferring ownership of IP to the company and requiring secrecy_)

- **Clean Break from Prior Employers**

  - Founders should fully separate from previous employers to prevent claims on IP developed for the new venture

## Chapter 6: Control Terms

Chapter 6 of _Venture Deals_ delves into the **control terms** (provisions in a deal that allow an investor to influence or veto certain company decisions) of a venture capital **term sheet** (a summary document of key terms for a financing). These terms are crucial because, even if venture capitalists (**VCs**) (individuals who invest in startup companies) typically own less than 50% of a company, these provisions often grant them significant influence over major company actions. Understanding these mechanisms helps entrepreneurs navigate the complex dynamics of investor relationships beyond just the financial aspects of a deal.

## Board of Directors

This section focuses on one of the most powerful **control mechanisms** (provisions that give investors influence or veto power) in a company: the composition and powers of the **Board of Directors** (a group of people elected by a company's shareholders to represent all stakeholders and oversee company management). The board has the authority to approve critical actions such as:

- Budgets
- Option plans
- Mergers
- Hiring or firing of the **CEO** (Chief Executive Officer)

Entrepreneurs should carefully consider the balance of representation on the board among:

- Investors
- Company executives
- Founders
- **Outside board members** (independent members not affiliated with the company or its major investors)

Typical early-stage boards usually consist of 3 to 5 members, often including:

- The **founder**/**CEO**
- A **VC investor representative**
- One or two **outside members**

This ensures a balance of influence.

## Protective Provisions

**Protective provisions** (effectively veto rights that investors have over certain actions by the company) are a key **control term** (a provision allowing investors to influence company decisions) that safeguard a **VC’s** (venture capitalist's) investment by preventing the company from taking harmful actions without investor consent.

These provisions grant **VCs** veto rights over decisions such as:

- Altering rights of their **preferred stock**
- Increasing or decreasing authorized shares
- Creating new stock classes with superior rights
- Selling the company (**Change in Control** or **liquidation**)
- Amending the **Certificate of Incorporation** or **Bylaws**
- Changing board size
- Paying a **dividend**
- Incurring significant **debt**
- Filing for voluntary bankruptcy
- Licensing **intellectual property** (patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets)
- Engaging in **initial coin offerings (ICOs)**

A common point of contention is the use of **materiality qualifiers** (e.g., inserting the word "material" into clauses), which **VCs** often avoid for clarity.

## Drag-Along Agreement

The **drag-along agreement** (a clause that allows a majority group of shareholders to force a minority group of shareholders to join in the sale of a company) ensures that if a majority of preferred shareholders agree to sell or liquidate the company, all other shareholders, including founders, must also consent and sell their shares.

This provision is important when:

- The company must be sold at a lower price (possibly below **liquidation preferences**)
- A founder has left the company

It prevents a small group from blocking a sale that benefits the majority. Entrepreneurs may negotiate for **drag-along rights** to apply only to a majority of **common stock** (typically held by founders and employees).

## Conversion

**Conversion** (the process by which preferred stock is converted to common stock) is typically a **nonnegotiable term** (a term that is almost impossible to change) in **VC** deals.

Key points:

- Grants **preferred shareholders** the right to convert to **common stock** at any time
- Usually done at a **1:1 conversion rate**
- During a **liquidation event**, investors can choose the more favorable outcome between their **liquidation preference** or **as-converted common stock**
- Required during an **IPO**, as investment bankers typically mandate conversion to **common stock**

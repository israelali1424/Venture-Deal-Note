# **Chapter 12 – How Venture Capital Funds Work**

*Venture Deals by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson*

This chapter gives founders a behind-the-scenes look at how venture capital funds operate, highlighting fund structure, economics, timing, and motivations that impact investor behavior.

---

## **Overview of a Typical Structure**

* **Management Company**: Pays salaries and covers firm expenses.
* **Limited Partnership (LP) Vehicle**: Holds capital from limited partners.
* **General Partnership (GP) Entity**: Legal entity representing general partners.
* These structures may have **different incentives**, which can impact founder interactions.

---

## **How Firms Raise Money**

* VCs raise capital from:

  * High-net-worth individuals
  * Endowments
  * Foundations
* **Commitment Period**: Typically 5 years to make new investments.
* LPs fund the VC through **capital calls**.
* VCs aim to deploy 100% of committed capital, often using **recycled returns**.

---

## **How Venture Capitalists Make Money**

* **Management Fees**:

  * 2–2.5% of committed capital per year.
  * Used for salaries, rent, operations.
* **Carried Interest (Carry)**:

  * 20–30% of profits after LPs are repaid.
* **Clawback Provision**:

  * VCs must return excess carry if fund performance drops.

---

## **How Time Impacts Fund Activity**

* **Commitment Period**: \~5 years for new investments.
* **Fund Life (Investment Term)**: \~10 years, with possible extensions.
* After commitment ends, VCs can't invest in new companies from that fund.
* **Zombie funds**: Funds that can’t raise new capital and pressure companies to exit.

---

## **Reserves**

* Portion of capital **set aside for follow-on investments**.
* Amounts per company are not disclosed.
* Founders should ensure investors have reserves for future rounds.

---

## **Cash Flow**

* Funds must cover:

  * Direct investments
  * Management fees
  * Operational costs
* **Recycling** early returns helps VCs fully deploy capital.
* Unpredictable exits can cause **cash flow constraints**.

---

## **Cross-Fund Investing**

* When a firm invests in one company using **multiple funds** (e.g., Fund III and Fund IV).
* Used when reserves in older funds are depleted.
* Can cause complexity for LPs with different expectations and terms.

---

## **Departing Partners**

* May trigger **key person clause** in the LP agreement.
* Can lead LPs to suspend or end the fund.
* If economic interests are unvested, disputes can arise.
* Founders should be aware, even if they can’t prevent partner exits.

---

## **Corporate Venture Capital (CVC)**

* VC arms of large corporations.
* **Motivations**:

  * Tech insight
  * Strategic partnerships
  * Competitive positioning
* Often offer higher valuations, but may request:

  * **Rights of first refusal on acquisitions** (should be avoided)

---

## **Strategic Investors**

* Includes CVCs and other companies with strategic goals beyond returns.
* May provide:

  * Market access
  * Tech integration
  * Competitive edge
* Risks:

  * Misaligned incentives
  * Potential conflicts if the investor is also a customer/partner

---

## **Fiduciary Duties**

* VCs owe duties to:

  * Their LPs
  * Management company
  * Boards of portfolio companies
* CVCs also answer to their parent corporations.
* These conflicting duties can impact VC behavior—founders should use legal counsel to stay informed.

---

## **Implications for the Entrepreneur**

* Understand how VC **incentives and fund dynamics** affect their decisions.
* Internal VC challenges can shape how they support your company.
* Founders should:

  * Proactively ask about fund dynamics
  * Communicate openly to avoid surprises

---

## **Chapter 12 Recap**

Chapter 12 explains how VC funds really work—beyond the term sheet:

* **Legal Structures**: Management Co., LP, GP
* **Income**: Management fees + carry, subject to clawbacks
* **Time**: Commitment period vs. fund life
* **Follow-on Capital**: Reserves matter
* **Challenges**: Cross-fund investing, partner departures
* **Investor Types**: Traditional VC vs. CVC vs. strategic
* **Duties**: VCs juggle many obligations

**Key Message**: Founders must understand how VCs operate financially and legally to navigate fundraising and relationships with confidence and clarity.

# **Understanding Corporate Venture Capital (CVC)**

*How CVCs differ from traditional VCs and what it means for entrepreneurs*

---

## **How Corporate Venture Capital Works**

* **Funding and Structure**

  * CVCs often invest **directly from their parent company’s balance sheet**, unlike traditional VCs that raise capital from external **limited partners (LPs)**.
  * Some CVCs are structured similarly to VCs, but many do **not have separate fund structures**, which affects their operations and flexibility.

* **Reporting and Accountability**

  * Traditional VCs report to LPs.
  * CVCs report to **internal corporate stakeholders** like:

    * Executive leadership
    * Business units
    * Shareholders
    * Public markets (quarterly earnings)
  * This creates **pressures beyond pure financial returns**.

* **Capital Availability**

  * Funding can fluctuate based on:

    * The **parent company’s stock price**
    * Its **financial performance**
  * Future funding from a CVC may become **uncertain** if the corporation cuts spending or changes strategy.

* **Compensation and Turnover**

  * CVC team members are typically **corporate employees**:

    * Paid with salary, bonus, and corporate stock
    * No access to **carried interest**
  * This structure leads to **higher turnover** as top talent is poached by traditional VC firms offering better upside.

* **Board Involvement**

  * Some CVCs take board seats, but many prefer **observer roles**.
  * Legal teams often **limit involvement** to avoid:

    * IP conflicts
    * Legal risk
    * Governance entanglement

---

## **How CVC Incentives Differ from Traditional VCs**

* **Strategic Objectives Over Financial Returns**
  CVCs often invest to achieve:

  * Early **access to emerging tech**
  * New **distribution or go-to-market** partners
  * **Blocking competitors** via early stake
  * Insight into startups for **future acquisition** or integration

* **Valuation Willingness**

  * CVCs may offer **higher valuations** due to strategic interests
  * Be cautious—**inflated valuations** can hurt follow-on funding rounds

* **Control and Rights**

  * CVCs may ask for **more control**, like:

    * **Right of first refusal on acquisitions** → **Founders should never grant this**
  * Such rights can **block exits** or complicate future deals

* **Potential Conflicts of Interest**

  * Key risk areas:

    * Using a competitor’s tech
    * Competing directly with the parent company
    * Sharing sensitive IP or customer info
  * Can create **ethical gray zones** in partnerships and product strategy

* **Relationship Dynamics**

  * CVCs may:

    * Become **overly passive** or **entitled**
    * Create tension if the startup explores third-party services or partnerships
  * Still, many CVC relationships are **mutually beneficial** when expectations are clear

* **Fiduciary Duties**

  * Traditional VCs owe duties to:

    * Their LPs
    * Their fund
    * The startup’s board
  * CVCs owe duties to **their parent company**
  * This creates **"fiduciary sandwich"** scenarios—conflicts of interest may emerge in critical moments

---

## **Key Takeaways for Founders**

* CVCs offer **capital and strategic value**, but also:

  * **Unpredictability in funding**
  * **Tougher alignment on incentives**
  * **Greater risk of control overreach**
* **Negotiate carefully**:

  * Avoid rights that **restrict future exits**
  * Assess long-term compatibility beyond the check size
* **Ask the right questions**:

  * Why is the CVC investing?
  * Who do they report to?
  * What happens if your product conflicts with their core business?

# 📘 _Venture Deals_ – Chapter 1 Summary

**"The Players" by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson**

This chapter is fundamental for understanding the various individuals and entities involved in venture capital financings and their roles, motivations, and impact on deal negotiations.

---

## 👤 The Entrepreneur

The **entrepreneur** (or **founder**) (_the person who creates a new company_) is the core of the startup universe.

- While co-founder relationships start strong, they can fray over time due to stress or changing priorities, leading to departures.
- Experienced investors anticipate these issues and structure deal terms to ensure clean resolutions, like **vesting** (_a process where stock ownership is earned over time or upon meeting milestones_).
- Entrepreneurs are strongly advised against outsourcing their direct involvement in financing negotiations, as many critical issues require their personal attention and direction.

## 💼 The Venture Capitalist (VC)

**Venture Capitalists (VCs)** (_a person who invests in startup companies_) operate within firms that have distinct internal hierarchies:

- **Managing Directors (MDs)** – _Senior partners who make final investment decisions and typically sit on company boards_
- **General Partners (GPs)** – _Often synonymous with MDs, holding ultimate decision-making authority_
- **Principals / Directors** – _Junior deal professionals needing senior support_
- **Associates** – _Scout deals, assist with **due diligence** (the process where investors investigate a company before investing), and manage the **capitalization table** (a spreadsheet detailing all company stock ownership)_
- **Venture / Operating Partners** – _Experienced entrepreneurs with part-time roles_
- **Entrepreneurs in Residence (EIRs)** – _Experienced entrepreneurs temporarily housed at a VC firm developing their next company_

> ⚠️ Entrepreneurs should research a VC's true authority due to common **title inflation** in the industry.

## 💸 Financing Round Nomenclature

Financing rounds follow a naming convention with no legal definitions:

- **Series A**, **Series B**, **Series C** – Successive institutional funding rounds
- **Series Seed** – _Very early-stage investment, typically pre-Series A_
- **Pre-Seed Round** – _An even earlier round before the seed round_
- **Series B-1**, **B-2** – _Used to raise additional capital within the same round_

**Stages of funding:**

- _Early-stage:_ Pre-Seed, Seed, Series A
- _Mid-stage:_ Series B, C, D
- _Late-stage:_ Series E and beyond

## 🏢 Types of Venture Capital Firms

VC firms are categorized by the stage of investment:

- **Micro VC funds** – _Small firms (<\$15M), often started by **angel investors** (individuals investing their own money)_
- **Seed stage funds** – _Up to \$150M; aim to be the first institutional investors_
- **Early stage funds** – _\$100–300M; invest in Seed and Series A rounds; often exercise **pro rata** (the right to purchase future shares in proportion to current ownership)_

> 🎯 Entrepreneurs must target firms aligned with their stage of growth.

---

## 👼 The Angel Investor

**Angel investors** (_individuals who provide capital at early stages using their own money_) are essential early-stage supporters.

- Often do not participate in future rounds
- Their inactivity in later rounds can trigger provisions like:

  - **Pay-to-play** (_forces investors to invest in future rounds or face consequences_)
  - **Drag-along rights** (_forces minority shareholders to sell if the majority agrees_)

- Must typically be **accredited investors** (\*meeting income or net worth criteria defined by the SEC, especially post-**JOBS Act\***)
- **Super angels** – _Highly active angel investors_
- **Micro VCs** – _Angels who raise funds from others, incurring **fiduciary responsibility** (a legal duty to act in investors' best interests)_

---

## 🤝 The Syndicate

A **syndicate** (_a group of investors who invest collectively in a company_) is common in VC rounds.

- Has a **lead investor** (_the main negotiator who represents the group_)
- Lead simplifies negotiations, but entrepreneurs must still:

  - Communicate with all members
  - Avoid **party rounds** (_rounds with too many small investors, reducing commitment and leadership_)

---

## ⚖️ The Lawyer

An experienced lawyer is **indispensable** in venture deals.

- Helps founders focus on **key concepts of economics and control** (_the financial returns and governance structures in a deal_)
- A bad lawyer may:

  - Chase irrelevant issues
  - Increase costs
  - Harm the founder’s reputation

> ✅ Choose lawyers who specialize in VC deals and can defer payment until closing.

---

## 📊 The Accountant

Accountants are rarely involved early unless:

- There's a complex tax or restructuring scenario
- Transitioning from **LLC to C-Corp**

They become more important later for:

- **Stock option pricing**
- **Tax compliance**

> 📍 Tip: Use mid-size or startup-focused local firms.

---

## 🏦 The Banker

Bankers are **rarely used in early-stage (<\$50M)** financings.

- Their involvement may signal:

  - Fundraising problems
  - Poor advice
  - Investor distrust

They are more valid in later-stage rounds involving:

- Strategic investors
- Acquisitions

---

## 🧓 The Mentor

**Mentors** (_unpaid advisors who offer guidance_) are crucial, especially when well-connected in VC circles.

- Different from **advisers** (_often compensated via fees or equity_)
- Early-stage founders should be cautious about giving away equity too soon
- Small success fees or vesting equity may be reasonable for truly helpful mentors

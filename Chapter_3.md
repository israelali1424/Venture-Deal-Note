## Chapter 3: Do. Or Do Not. There Is No Try.

Chapter 3 of _Venture Deals_ emphasizes that **entrepreneurs** (founders of startups) must approach fundraising with **full commitment**. Using tentative language like “trying to raise money” suggests a lack of seriousness and may deter potential **investors** (individuals or firms who provide capital with expectations of financial return). The only exception to this is informal networking or exploratory meetings. Once committed, **entrepreneurs** should proceed with confidence and intent.

## Determine How Much You Are Raising

Setting a **clear fundraising target** is a crucial first step. The amount should reflect:

- The capital needed to reach the next major **milestone** (e.g., MVP launch, revenue goal).
- An estimate of the **burn rate** (monthly cash expenditure).
- A cushion of approximately 12 months of **runway**.

> 🔍 **Extra Note**: Asking for more than what you need may raise red flags and make the round harder to close. Investors prefer rounds that feel **tight** or **oversubscribed**—this signals demand and momentum.

Entrepreneurs should **avoid stating a range** and instead communicate a **precise target** to demonstrate strategic planning.

## Fundraising Materials

Before contacting **investors**, founders should prepare core materials:

- **Elevator pitch**: A 1–3 paragraph concise business summary for emails and intros.
- **Executive summary**: A 1–3 page document covering the problem, solution, product, team, and high-level financials.
- **Pitch deck**: A 10–20 slide presentation that stands alone as a compelling visual narrative of the business.

Less commonly used documents:

- **Business plan**: A traditional long-form document; mostly outdated.
- **Private Placement Memorandum (PPM)**: A formal legal document—typically unnecessary for early-stage startups.

> 🔍 **Extra Note**: A working **demo** or product prototype is often the most persuasive tool—it makes the vision tangible for investors.

---

## Due Diligence Preparation

**Due diligence** is the process by which **investors** validate the business before closing a deal. Founders should proactively prepare:

- **Cap table** (Capitalization Table): A spreadsheet detailing all equity holders and ownership percentages.
- **Legal docs**: Board minutes, contracts, incorporation documents.
- **Data site**: A secure virtual folder where all diligence materials are organized and accessible.

> 🔍 **Extra Note**: Transparency builds trust. Disclosing known issues early may not kill a deal—hiding them will.

---

## Finding the Right VC

Warm introductions from trusted **entrepreneurs** or mutual contacts are ideal. Cold outreach is far less effective.

Research **VC firms** and individual partners to understand:

- Stage focus (Seed, Series A, etc.)
- Industry focus
- Reputation and **portfolio**

> 🔍 **Extra Note**: Read partner blogs, listen to interviews, and engage authentically (e.g., thoughtful blog comments).

---

## Finding a Lead VC

The **lead VC** is the investor who typically:

- Sets the **terms**.
- Negotiates the **term sheet**.
- Takes a **board seat**.

You’ll encounter several types of responses:

- ✅ "Yes" – strong interest and willingness to lead.
- ❌ "No" – clear rejection.
- 🤷 "Maybe" – lukewarm; rarely leads.
- 💤 "Slow No" – ongoing ambiguity with no action.

> 🔍 **Extra Note**: Be ruthless with your time. Focus on engaged VCs, and walk away from time-wasters.

---

## How VCs Decide to Invest

Understand your contact's **decision-making authority**:

- **Associate**: Often the first point of contact but lacks authority to make decisions.
- **General Partner/Managing Director**: Decision-makers within the firm.

During **due diligence**, VCs review:

- Financials
- Market opportunity
- Product
- Founding team
- Legal structure

**Founders** should also conduct **reverse diligence**: speak to other founders—especially ones whose companies didn’t succeed.

---

## Creating Competition Among VCs

Multiple interested **VCs** create **leverage** during negotiation. Steps:

- Run a **tight, time-bound process** (3–6 months).
- Engage multiple **VCs** in parallel without disclosing names.
- Aim to receive multiple **term sheets** around the same time.

> 🔍 **Extra Note**: Coordinated timing can lead to better **valuation**, governance terms, and faster closes.

---

## Closing the Deal

Two primary steps:

1. **Sign the term sheet**: High-level summary of terms.
2. **Negotiate and sign definitive documents**: Full legal paperwork and wire transfer.

With **reputable early-stage VCs**, signing a **term sheet** usually leads to a closed deal. But later-stage or less experienced investors may back out during legal diligence.

> 🔍 **Extra Note**: Ensure your legal counsel works collaboratively—not combatively—with investors’ counsel to avoid unnecessary delays.

- Adopt an “all-in” mindset.
- Determine a precise funding amount based on real milestones.
- Prepare materials that showcase vision and traction.
- Target the right **VCs** with thoughtful, research-driven outreach.

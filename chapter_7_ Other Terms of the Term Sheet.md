# **Chapter 7 – Other Terms of the Term Sheet**

*Venture Deals by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson*

While not as critical as economic or control terms, the terms in this chapter are important for entrepreneurs—especially in downside scenarios or when clarifying investor relationships.

---

## **Dividends**

* Dividends = payouts to investors (cash or stock).
* Rarely prioritized in early-stage VC deals.
* Two types:

  * **Noncumulative**: do not accrue if unpaid.
  * **Cumulative**: accrue if not paid.
* Stock dividends may act as anti-dilution over time.

---

## **Redemption Rights**

* Let investors force the company to buy back shares.
* Rarely exercised, but offer downside protection.
* Key for funds nearing the end of their lifecycle.
* Can create balance sheet liabilities.
* **Adverse change redemption** is especially punitive.

---

## **Conditions Precedent to Financing**

* Must be satisfied before financing closes.
* Usually non-binding (except legal fees, no-shop).
* Watch out for:

  * “Approval by investors’ partnerships”
  * “Employment agreements signed by founders”

---

## **Information Rights**

* Define what info (e.g., financials) the company must regularly provide to investors.
* Usually not contentious.
* Transparency is beneficial.
* Key variable: share threshold required to retain rights.

---

## **Registration Rights**

* Allow investors to register shares for public sale (IPO).
* Types:

  * **Demand rights**
  * **Piggyback rights**
  * **Lockup provisions**
* Not worth heavy negotiation—only relevant in IPO success cases.

---

## **Right of First Refusal (ROFR)**

* AKA **pro rata rights**.
* Investors can buy their proportional share in future financings.
* Watch for:

  * Definition of **major investor**
  * **Super pro rata rights** (excessive)

---

## **Voting Rights**

* Dictate how preferred vs. common stock vote.
* Generally simple; most control lies elsewhere (e.g., protective provisions).

---

## **Restriction on Sales**

* Governs private share sales by current shareholders.
* Important due to the rise of secondary markets.
* Helps company maintain control over cap table.

---

## **Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement**

* Ensures company owns all IP developed by employees or contractors.
* Critical for avoiding future IP issues in fundraising/acquisitions.
* Should be signed early.

---

## **Co-Sale Agreement**

* If a founder sells shares, investors can sell proportionally too.
* Typically ends after a **Qualified IPO**.
* May negotiate small-sale thresholds (floors).

---

## **Founders’ Activities**

* Requires founders to work full-time for the company.
* May flag investor concerns about side projects.
* Acceptable if the founder is fully focused.

---

## **Initial Public Offering Shares Purchase**

* Lets VCs buy IPO shares at offering price.
* Not critical today—investment banks control IPO allocations.

---

## **No-Shop Agreement**

* Prohibits seeking other investors after signing term sheet.
* Binding term.
* Entrepreneurs should:

  * Set time limits.
  * Add a termination trigger if deal doesn’t close.

---

## **Indemnification**

* Ensures company protects officers/directors from liability.
* Common, but less negotiated than in acquisition deals.

---

## **Assignment**

* Lets VCs transfer shares to affiliates without company consent.
* Important for VC fund management.
* Transfers must maintain same rights/terms.

---

## **Chapter 7 Recap**

This chapter covers less prominent but still essential terms in a venture term sheet. While they might not impact valuation or board control, they matter—especially in edge cases or exits. Founders who understand these terms are better prepared to:

* Navigate VC negotiations
* Avoid unpleasant surprises
* Align terms with long-term company vision

Strong relationships and informed negotiation go hand-in-hand.
